# Scratch NXT Support
Accessible at https://sanjay900.github.io/scratch-nxt/

This adds the ability to control LEGO Mindstorms NXT Vehicles from scratch. It runs a program on the device to control the motors, and will automatically start this program, and upload if if required. A configuration panel is exposed for configuring the vehicle when you connect. This application supports the ability to control both front steering based vehicles (Aka standard car steering) and tank based steering.

This NXT implementation is based on https://github.com/sanjay900/nxt, and documentation can be found at https://github.com/sanjay900/nxt/tree/master/documentation for the onboard application.
