# Scratch NXT Support

Based on the EV3 implementation, however this implementation is designed for driving vehicles, and as a result
uses an application running on the device to control motors, and as a result does not control motors directly.

This implementation is based on https://github.com/sanjay900/nxt, and documentation can be found at https://github.com/sanjay900/nxt/tree/master/documentation for the onboard application.
